Description: BGP/OSPF/RIP routing daemon
 Frr is free software which manages TCP/IP based routing protocols.
 It supports BGP4, BGP4+, OSPFv2, OSPFv3, IS-IS, RIPv1, RIPv2, and RIPng as
 well as the IPv6 versions of these.
 .
 Frr uses threading if the kernel supports it, but can also run on
 kernels that do not support threading. Each protocol has its own daemon.
 .
 It is more than a routed replacement, it can be used as a Route Server and
 a Route Reflector.
