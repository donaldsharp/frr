Overview

`FRR`_ is a routing software package that provides TCP/IP based
routing services with routing protocols support such as RIPv1, RIPv2, RIPng,
OSPFv2, OSPFv3, IS-IS, BGP-4, and BGP-4+ (:ref:`supported-rfcs`). FRR also
supports special BGP Route Reflector and Route Server behavior.  In addition to
traditional IPv4 routing protocols, FRR also supports IPv6 routing protocols.
With SNMP daemon which supports SMUX and AgentX protocol, FRR provides routing
protocol MIBs (:ref:`snmp-support`).

FRR uses an advanced software architecture to provide you with a high
quality, multi server routing engine. FRR has an interactive user
interface for each routing protocol and supports common client commands.
Due to this design, you can add new protocol daemons to FRR easily.  You
can use FRR library as your program's client user interface.

FRR is distributed under the GNU General Public License.

About FRR
=========

Today, TCP/IP networks are covering all of the world.  The Internet has
been deployed in many countries, companies, and to the home.  When you
connect to the Internet your packet will pass many routers which have TCP/IP
routing functionality.

A system with FRR installed acts as a dedicated router.  With FRR,
your machine exchanges routing information with other routers using routing
protocols.  FRR uses this information to update the kernel routing table
so that the right data goes to the right place.  You can dynamically change
the configuration and you may view routing table information from the FRR
terminal interface.

Adding to routing protocol support, FRR can setup interface's flags,
interface's address, static routes and so on.  If you have a small network,
or a stub network, or xDSL connection, configuring the FRR routing
software is very easy.  The only thing you have to do is to set up the
interfaces and put a few commands about static routes and/or default routes.
If the network is rather large, or if the network structure changes
frequently, you will want to take advantage of FRR's dynamic routing
protocol support for protocols such as RIP, OSPF, IS-IS or BGP.

Traditionally, UNIX based router configuration is done by
*ifconfig* and *route* commands.  Status of routing
table is displayed by *netstat* utility.  Almost of these commands
work only if the user has root privileges.  FRR has a different system
administration method.  There are two user modes in FRR.  One is normal
mode, the other is enable mode.  Normal mode user can only view system
status, enable mode user can change system configuration.  This UNIX account
independent feature will be great help to the router administrator.

Currently, FRR supports common unicast routing protocols, that is BGP,
OSPF, RIP and IS-IS.  Upcoming for MPLS support, an implementation of LDP is
currently being prepared for merging.  Implementations of BFD and PIM-SSM
(IPv4) also exist, but are not actively being worked on.

The ultimate goal of the FRR project is making a productive, quality, free
TCP/IP routing software package.


System Architecture
===================

.. index:: System architecture

.. index:: Software architecture

.. index:: Software internals

Traditional routing software is made as a one process program which
provides all of the routing protocol functionalities.  FRR takes a
different approach.  It is made from a collection of several daemons that
work together to build the routing table.  There may be several
protocol-specific routing daemons and zebra the kernel routing manager.

The *ripd* daemon handles the RIP protocol, while
*ospfd* is a daemon which supports OSPF version 2.
*bgpd* supports the BGP-4 protocol.  For changing the kernel
routing table and for redistribution of routes between different routing
protocols, there is a kernel routing table manager *zebra* daemon.
It is easy to add a new routing protocol daemons to the entire routing
system without affecting any other software.  You need to run only the
protocol daemon associated with routing protocols in use.  Thus, user may
run a specific daemon and send routing reports to a central routing console.

There is no need for these daemons to be running on the same machine. You
can even run several same protocol daemons on the same machine.  This
architecture creates new possibilities for the routing system.

   +------------------------------+

       FRR System Architecture


Multi-process architecture brings extensibility, modularity and
maintainability.  At the same time it also brings many configuration files
and terminal interfaces.  Each daemon has it's own configuration file and
terminal interface.  When you configure a static route, it must be done in
*zebra* configuration file.  When you configure BGP network it must
be done in *bgpd* configuration file.  This can be a very annoying
thing.  To resolve the problem, FRR provides integrated user interface
shell called *vtysh*.  *vtysh* connects to each daemon with
UNIX domain socket and then works as a proxy for user input.

FRR was planned to use multi-threaded mechanism when it runs with a
kernel that supports multi-threads.  But at the moment, the thread library
which comes with GNU/Linux or FreeBSD has some problems with running
reliable services such as routing software, so we don't use threads at all.
Instead we use the *select(2)* system call for multiplexing the
events.


Supported Platforms
===================

.. index:: Supported platforms

.. index:: FRR on other systems

.. index:: Compatibility with other systems

.. index:: Operating systems that support FRR

Currently FRR supports GNU/Linux and BSD. Porting FRR
to other platforms is not too difficult as platform dependent code should
most be limited to the *zebra* daemon.  Protocol daemons are mostly
platform independent. Please let us know when you find out FRR runs on a
platform which is not listed below.

The list of officially supported platforms are listed below. Note that
FRR may run correctly on other platforms, and may run with partial
functionality on further platforms.

- GNU/Linux
- FreeBSD
- NetBSD
- OpenBSD

Versions of these platforms that are older than around 2 years from the point
of their original release (in case of GNU/Linux, this is since the kernel's
release on https://kernel.org/) may need some work.  Similarly, the following platforms
may work with some effort:

- Solaris
- MacOS

Also note that, in particular regarding proprietary platforms, compiler
and C library choice will affect FRR.  Only recent versions of the
following C compilers are well-tested:

- GNU's GCC
- LLVM's clang
- Intel's ICC
